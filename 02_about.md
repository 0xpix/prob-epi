# About this course

These lecture notes cover the course which will be taught during three weeks from 25 March to 12 April 2024 to a MSc ["AI for Science"](https://ai.aims.ac.za/) cohort at the [African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS)](https://aims.ac.za/), South Africa. After the course, I plan to keep improving and expanding the materials since they will be helpful for future stundents and collaborators.

## Content

In this course we will cover such topics as Bayesian inference for hierarchical modelling, Gaussian processes for spatial statistics, ordinary differential equations for disease transmission modelling. We will build probabilistic models and perform inference using `Numpyro` probabilistic programminv language in a fully Bayesian manner to characterise uncertainty of the modelled quantities.

Although the course is primarily <span style="color:orange">computational</span> in nature, the models which we will examine are inspired by the typical modelling practices found in epidemiology.

Tentative outline of the course is presented below (but might be adjusted during the course).

* <span style="color:orange">Week 1</span>
    * Bayesian inference
    * Probabilistic programming
    * Bayesian workflow
    * Hierarchical Bayesian models

    * Time series modelling with autoregressive models
    * Gaussain Processes
    * Spatial modelling: kriging
    * Spatial modelling: areal data
* <span style="color:orange">Week 3</span>
    * Infectious disease modelling
    * Bayesian optimisation and active learning
    * Deep generative models and how they can help

## Prerequisites

- Conditional probability
- Joint probability
- Python: `numpy`, `matplotlib`

## Evaluation

Throughout the course, you will see a set of `Tasks` in the lecture notes. You need to submit answers to all of the tasks in one executable file (a Colab link or `.ipynb`).

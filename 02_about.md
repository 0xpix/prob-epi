# About this course

These lecture notes cover the course which will be taught during three weeks from 25 March to 12 April 2024 to a MSc ["AI for Science"](https://ai.aims.ac.za/) cohort at the [African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS)](https://aims.ac.za/), South Africa. After the course, I plan to keep improving the materials since they will be helpful for future stundents and collaborators.

Tentative outline of the course is presented below but might be adjusted at a later point.

## Acknowledgements and links
- AIMS and Ulrich personally for the invitation
- [Machine Learning and Global Health](mlgh.net/people) network for many things, but in  particular for the (virtual, at the time) space where I learnt Numpyro through a reading group together with some MLGH members: Swapnil Mishra, Iwona Hawryluk, Tim Wolock, Theo Rashid, Giovanni Charles
- Co-authors of the paper [Bayesian workflow for disease transmission modeling in Stan](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sim.9164) and all particiapnts of the regular Thursday Stan call which enabled me to co-author
- Lorenzo Ciardo from Kellogg College at Oxford for telling me about the Buffon's needle problem
- Richard McEarlth for posting the [prior-likelihood conflict example](https://twitter.com/rlmcelreath/status/1701165075493470644)
- Darren Wilkinson for the brilliant GP visualisation idea which he's been presenting for years at GPSS
- Previous workshops on which I tought and which served as a basis fort this extended course: 
    - [AMLD 2020 workshop](https://github.com/elizavetasemenova/EmbracingUncertainty) "Bayesian Inference: embracing uncertainty" with Julia + Turing.jl, R + Stan and Python+PyMC3.
    - [Nordic ProbAI 2022](https://probabilistic.ai/) lecture on Bayesian workflow
- Kira Duesterwald and James Allingham for writing together the [DLI-23](https://github.com/deep-learning-indaba/indaba-pracs-2023) practical, which is used in the chapter on probability distributions and random variables
- Stan Lazic, whose reflections on his book wiritng experience made me realise that I, most likelily, don't want to extend these lecture notes to a book :) 
- Impeiral College London, [Epidemiology and Biostatistics](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/school-public-health/epidemiology-and-biostatistics/) department that recently hired me as a lecturer
